### setup.py
what is setup.py and how is it used?  Is it compatible with python 3?  It is part of the assignment 4 zip file but it has never been explained.  


## assignment 4.
the zip file (containing 14 files, 7 folders and a setup.py) seems convoluted and isn't helping cement metaprogramming concepts (at least for me).  totally lost on what to do with all these files, perhaps you can help unravel it.
